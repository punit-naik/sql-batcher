## Rationale

If an update/delete query is doing a large table scan and spanning a large number of rows, that table could be blocked for a potentially very long time. To avoid this, we run our update/delete queries in batches of relatively small sizes, based on the primary key(s) of the table to on which the updates/deletes are supposed to run.
